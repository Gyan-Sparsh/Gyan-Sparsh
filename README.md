## Abstract

Educational meetings are an essential tool for knowledge sharing and learning. These meetings are typically conducted in a single language, often English, which can pose a significant barrier to individuals who are not fluent in the language used. This can result in a significant portion of the population being left out of important discussions and knowledge sharing. Similarly, individuals with hearing impairments face significant barriers in accessing educational meetings as they rely on sign language interpreters or captioning to understand the content of the meeting. This can lead to a lack of inclusivity and equity in learning environments.

Our project aims to address this problem by developing an application that caters to the needs of individuals with diverse linguistic and hearing abilities. Our application will provide three different modes of accessing educational meetings. Firstly, it will cater to individuals who understand the language used in the meeting. Secondly, it will provide a text-to-text translation feature for individuals who want to listen to the meeting in their mother tongue. Lastly, it will cater to deaf individuals by converting text to sign language phrases and rendering them with 3D avatars along with the visuals of the meeting.

Our application will provide a user-friendly interface that allows individuals to select the mode that suits them best. The application will also provide features such as live captioning, which will ensure that individuals can follow along with the meeting even if they miss a few words. Additionally, the application will allow individuals to save transcripts of the meeting, which they can refer to later for study or reference purposes. This application will bridge the language and hearing gaps, ensuring that everyone can access education and knowledge sharing, regardless of their linguistic or hearing abilities. Our project will promote equal access to education and knowledge sharing, ensuring that no one is left out of important discussions and knowledge sharing.
